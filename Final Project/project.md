**RealTime University Management System using Python**

This code is not intended to use in a professional way. It's just for idea that how could we developed such a big system for university. 
Obviously, the code is not written in the best way, so there are chances for improvement. I will be making updates to the code. 
If you got any bugs or issues, feel free to share with me. 

**Thanks ðŸ˜Š**
